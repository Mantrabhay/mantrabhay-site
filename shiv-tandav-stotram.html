<h2>Meaning of Shiv Tandav Stotram</h2>

<div class="meaning">

<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>
Lord Shiva, whose matted locks release the sacred river Ganga to purify the earth, who wears mighty serpents as a garland around his neck, and whose damru resounds with the powerful rhythm of “Damad Damad Damad”, performs the fierce cosmic Tandava dance. May that divine Shiva bless us with auspiciousness and peace.
</p>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>
On Shiva’s head flows the sacred Ganga with swirling waves, sparkling like droplets dancing upon his matted hair. Upon his blazing forehead burns the fire of destruction, yet the gentle crescent moon also rests there. With deep devotion and love, I bow to that Lord Shiva at every moment.
</p>

<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p>
May my mind rejoice in Lord Shiva, the beloved of Parvati, daughter of the mountain king. As he performs his divine dance, his heart overflows with supreme bliss. His compassionate glance removes suffering and grants peace, and he stands as the eternal sky-clad Lord.
</p>

<h3>Verse 4</h3>
<p>
May my mind delight in that extraordinary Lord of all beings whose matted hair is adorned with serpents shining like precious gems. His divine face glows with sacred red powder, and he wears the skin of the slain elephant as his garment, symbolizing his power over ego and pride.
</p>

<h3>Verse 5</h3>
<p>
May Lord Shiva bless us with prosperity and spiritual strength. The dust of flowers offered by the gods adorns his sacred feet. His matted locks hold a garland of mighty serpents, and the crescent moon shines brilliantly upon his head.
</p>
